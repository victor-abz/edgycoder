## Hi there üëã
I'm **GayCookie** previously known as Kawaaii/EdgyCoder.  
- üë®‚Äçüíª I'm some sort of a full-stack developer? If [this](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp) description makes me a full-stack developer.
- üå± I work a lot with Javascript especially with NodeJS and I'm afraid for languages such as C++
- üéÆ I like gaming but I never know which games I wanna play and never play a game for long!
- üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è While I don't work much with others, I like to discuss coding with others and learn more.
- üì´ I do not write blog posts and my twitter is mostly used when I'm bored or waiting for something.
- ‚ùì Want to know more about me? You can always contact me via several social media!
